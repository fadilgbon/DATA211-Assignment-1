#Question 1: Controlled Multiplication Loop : Program that multiplies consecutive integers starting from 1 until the product exceeds a specified threshold, then prints the final product and the number that caused it to pass the threshold.

#Question 2: Nested Dictionary from Strings : Function that takes a list of strings and returns a dictionary where each string maps to its length and whether that length is even or odd.

#Question 3: Safe Function Application: Power function and apply it to a list of (x, y) pairs using a loop, skipping any pair where the exponent is negative and storing valid results in a list.

#Question 4: Generates a list of random numbers, sort it, and find the indices where values are greater than or equal to a randomly chosen number, printing the first valid index if it exists.

#Question 5: Function that validates two positive integer radii, calculates their areas, and returns the percentage of the larger circle’s area covered by the smaller one

#Question 6: Function that returns a sorted dictionary showing, for each unique number in a list, the percentage of elements less than or equal to that number.

#Question 7: Time Conversion Function: Develop a function that converts seconds since midnight into hours, minutes, seconds, and AM/PM format, returning an error message for invalid input.

#Question 8: Pandas Dataframe with Computed Column: Using pandas to create a DataFrame from given data, compute a new column based on existing columns, and print the resulting DataFrame.
